
Please first make sure that the makefile and all code files are present. 
Type "make" to compile the program, and then "make run" to run it. 

NOTE - When taking input for starting positions, I opted to start the board 
at 1, not 0. 

So, the possible starting position coordinates range from 1-8, not 0-7.
